# EDA_of_titanic_data
Summary:
1. Objective: Analyze Titanic data to identify survival factors.
2. Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
3. Dropped irrelevant columns: `PassengerId`, `Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`.
4. Filled missing `Age` and `Fare` with median, `Embarked` with mode.
5. Encoded `Sex` and `Embarked` into numeric values.
6. More people died (`Survived = 0`) than survived.
7. Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
8. 1st class passengers had better survival rates.
9. Children and higher-paying passengers were more likely to survive.
10. Dataset is now clean and ready for machine learning modeling.
